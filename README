= Blog

The Blog extension has been built to provide support for commonly used features of 
web logs.

Some features were pulled from and added to the Siblings Tags extension:
git://github.com/nelstrom/radiant-sibling-tags-extension.git

Built by Saturn Flyer http://www.saturnflyer.com and many others
Supported by Ignite Social Media http://www.ignitesocialmedia.com

TODO:
  - provide a more blog-like UI for new posts
  - create an AuthorIndexPage and an AuthorPage to easily list authors and their related details
